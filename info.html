            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The CARE Mission began in 1997 as a ministry at Main Street Baptist Church and was housed in a small closet. It started with one personâ€™s simple desire to meet the needs of the hungry in the community.)</p>
            <p>Since then, the Mission has grown into a community-operated food pantry and has outgrown three locations and is currently housed in an 8,000 square foot facility serving over 15,000 people annually.</p>
            <p>While Main Street remains the largest financial contributor and a huge supporter, the Mission is also supported by many community businesses, organizations, and individuals. Our supporters are continually hosting food drives, coat drives, or whatever-we-need drives in order to keep the Mission stocked.</p>
            <p>The CARE Mission is governed by a 12 member Board of Directors that works unselfishly to make sure the Mission is equipped to serve the less fortunate in our community.</p>
